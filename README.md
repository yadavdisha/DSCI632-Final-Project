**Spotify Song Popularity Project**

**About the Project**
In this project, I look at songs on Spotify to guess how popular they will be. I use different methods like Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Linear Regression to find out which one predicts song popularity best.

**Songs Data**
I use data from Spotify that shows things like the song's beat, mood, and how energetic it is. I also look at how popular the songs are.

**How I Did It**
Here’s what I did:

Making the Data Ready: I cleaned up the data so it’s ready for analysis.
Looking at the Data: I checked the data to see if there were any interesting patterns.
Choosing Features: I picked the most important parts of the data that might explain why a song is popular.
Building Models: I made different models to predict if a song will be popular.
Checking the Models: I checked to see which model gives the best predictions.
Results
I found that the Decision Tree model gave the best predictions. But I also made sure to consider how each model might work with new, unseen songs.

**Tools Used**
I used:

Python
Some Python tools like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
How to Run the Project
Download the project to your computer.
Make sure you have Python and all the necessary tools installed.
Open the Jupyter Notebooks to see my work and try it out yourself.
What I Found
This project helped me understand what might make a song popular on Spotify. I learned a lot from comparing different ways to predict popularity.
